# Uncovering Positionality in data-driven/AI cultural heritage pipelines 

## Short summary
This investigation aims to explore and develop a framework to uncover and assess positionality as it emerges in a series of data/AI-driven pipelines within the social machine of the Congruence Engine.  
Positionality is the culmination of a person’s personal experiences, cultural background, social context, and political environment. It serves as a lens through which they interpret and understand the world. Positionality, and how it embeds itself in processes and systems produced and performed by individuals, is the root for bias in our data and algorithm, and,thus, plays a significant role in the entire data lifecycle in digital cultural heritage pipelines, from the formulation of standards and ontologies, the collection and interpretation of data, to the development of data-focused AI tools, such as ML models. However, positionality is often overlooked in the context of data collection, analysis, and algorithm development. Without an awareness of positionality, the ongoing discussion about bias in data-driven approaches, especially AI and ML pipelines, remains constrained, as merely augmenting the dataset doesn't de-bias data and models.


In this investigation I will advocate and explore the framework for a paradigm shift towards positionality-aware data/AI -driven digital cultural heritage pipelines. By adopting a ‘walking alongside’ participatory research technique, in this investigation I will ‘shadow’ two ongoing CE investigations and use them as case-studies in order to unveil and analyze the subtle ways in which positionality infiltrates the pipeline of these investigations, often going unnoticed. By embracing positionality-aware data/AI- driven workflows, I seek to place the human and social element of the social machine (human-in-the-loop) at the forefront of our data-driven processes, while transcending the limitations of traditional bias mitigation strategies and fostering a more inclusive, responsible and equitable landscape for data/AI-driven digital cultural heritage.
